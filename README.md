# Project 4: INTERACTIVE INFORMATION POSTER
 The specific difference between this form of design and traditional infographics is the dynamic nature of the interactive information design. 

## Description

Develop a responsive one-page application to showcase an interactive implementation of your design. Please note that this means that you can consider how the graphics and interactivity evolve as a web app - it doesn’t need to be a static graphic with animated overlays. You can show pieces or elements of your design in sequence, animate them in, develop additional controls, animate the internal pieces… it’s entirely up to you.

The data that you harvest and use to drive the graphics on your printed piece should be stored in a database and retrieved as an object. This is the data source for your web application. Retrieve that data using a series of AJAX calls (you can do one main one, or break it apart into multiple calls and only retrieve the relevant data when needed). 

Part of the design process outlined above is consideration of UX - aesthetics and
engagement. This part of the project involves executing on those considerations with code - express your creativity with your Authoring skills.
